# NMEAIO
Visual Basic program that utilizes NMEA strings and IO code to troubleshoot GPS, DP Systems and Gyro equipment
This was again another program created to assist me in my job performance.  It allowed me to troubleshoot different types of equipment as they relate to Dynamic Position Control Systems.  As I uploaded them I could tell how much of a noob I am as I didn't even rename some of the default names provided when Visual Studio creates the base project!
